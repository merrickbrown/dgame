<a href="https://github.com/p0nce/gfm">GFM</a> is a feature-rich library to ease the creation of video games / multimedia applications with the D programming language. Pick what you need.
</p>

<h3>Overview:</h3>

<ul>    <p><li>gfm.core:
        <ul>            <li>: a dead simple queue/fifo/stack/ring-buffer, with a range interface. Synchronized queue for threads.</li>
            <li>: aligned malloc/free/realloc.</li>
         </ul>
    </li></p>
    <p><li>gfm.math:
        <ul>            <li>: small vectors for 2D and 3D.</li>
            <li>: small matrices for 2D and 3D.</li>
            <li>: quaternions.</li>
            <li>: 16-bit floating point type.</li>
            <li>: 2^N bits integers (recursive implementation, covers cent/ucent).</li>
            <li>: half-open intervals (for eg. AABB).</li>
            <li>: fixed-point numbers.</li>
            <li>: rational numbers.</li>
            <li>: random distributions: a port of SimpleRNG from John D. Cook.</li>
            <li>: segment, triangle, sphere, ray, plane, frustum.</li>
            <li>: useful math functions, polynomial solvers, statistics.</li>
         </ul>
    </li></p>
    <p><li>gfm.opengl:
        <ul>            <li>OpenGL wrapper based on package derelict-gl3.</li>
            <li>makes easier to use the OpenGL API correctly.</li>
            <li>including a matrix stack to replace fixed pipeline.</li>
            <li>including compilation of a single source for multiple shaders.</li>
            <li>practical shader uniforms support: set them at any time, with id caching, and support pruned uniforms.</li>
            <li>legacy multi-texture support which is needed for a low-spec game.</li>
            <li>built-in OpenGL debug output forwarding.</li>

         </ul>
    </li></p>

    <p><li>gfm.assimp:
        <ul>            <li>Assimp wrapper based on package derelict-assimp3.</li>
         </ul>
    </li></p>

<h3>Dealing with resources in D.</h3>

<p>
Resource management in D needs more care than it seems at first ; more so than in C++ and as much as in C#.
</p>

<p>
The crux of the matter is that <b>you cannot rely on a class destructor being called by the
GC or even class destruction order</b>.</p>

<p>A notable consequence is that <b>when a class instance destructor is
called, its members might have been destroyed already (unlike in C++).</b></p>

<p>
You can verify this fact here: .
</p>

<p>
To simplify, the <i>resource-ness</i> of a class leaks on anything that owns it.
This is an unavoidable fact of a GC with cycles and you have to deal with it, ie.
you have to call close() methods manually before it's too late.
</p>

<h4>How to deal with it:</h4>

<ul>  <li>Call close() manually on resource classes.</li>
  <li>A class with a close() method should have it called automatically by its destructor.</li>
  <li>Use such friendly resource classes with , , ,
    , or any other deterministic destruction mechanisms.</li>
  <li>For maximum usefulness, a close() method should support being called several times.</li>
</ul>
